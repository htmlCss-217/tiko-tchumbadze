                    A social network is a social structure made up of a set of 
                    social actors (such as individuals or organizations), 
                    sets of dyadic ties, and other social interactions between actors. 
                    The social network perspective provides a set of methods for 
                    analyzing the structure of whole social entities as well as a 
                    variety of theories explaining the patterns observed in these 
                    structures. The study of these structures uses social network 
                    analysis to identify local and global patterns, 
                    locate influential entities, and examine network dynamics.

                    Social networks and the analysis of them is an inherently 
                    interdisciplinary academic field which emerged from social 
                    psychology, sociology, statistics, and graph theory. 
                    Georg Simmel authored early structural theories in 
                    sociology emphasizing the dynamics of triads and "web of 
                    group affiliations".Jacob Moreno is credited with 
                    developing the first sociograms in the 1930s to study 
                    interpersonal relationships. These approaches were 
                    mathematically formalized in the 1950s and theories and 
                    methods of social networks became pervasive in the social 
                    and behavioral sciences by the 1980s. Social network 
                    analysis is now one of the major paradigms in contemporary 
                    sociology, and is also employed in a number of other 
                    social and formal sciences. Together with other complex 
                    networks, it forms part of the nascent field of network science.

                    The social network is a theoretical construct useful in 
                    the social sciences to study relationships between 
                    individuals, groups, organizations, or even entire 
                    societies (social units, see differentiation). The term is 
                    used to describe a social structure determined by such 
                    interactions. The ties through which any given social 
                    unit connects represent the convergence of the various 
                    social contacts of that unit. This theoretical approach is, 
                    necessarily, relational. An axiom of the social network 
                    approach to understanding social interaction is that social 
                    phenomena should be primarily conceived and investigated 
                    through the properties of relations between and within units, 
                    instead of the properties of these units themselves. Thus, 
                    one common criticism of social network theory is that 
                    individual agency is often ignored although this may not be 
                    the case in practice (see agent-based modeling). Precisely 
                    because many different types of relations, singular or in 
                    combination, form these network configurations, network 
                    analytics are useful to a broad range of research enterprises. 
                    In social science, these fields of study include, but are not 
                    limited to anthropology, biology, communication studies, 
                    economics, geography, information science, organizational 
                    studies, social psychology, sociology, and sociolinguistics.
